Rubin explains why the Web3 era of social media will help everybody get paid"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">After a decade<\/span> of a handful of dominant social media companies trading what are essentially publishing tools in exchange for serving us all an endless deluge of ads, the winds of change are finally blowing \u2014 in a few different directions at once.<\/p>\n<p>Content creators (arguably either a special echelon of influencers or anyone who posts online) are slowly siphoning off some of the power that social media companies have wielded for years. Meanwhile, decentralization is sweeping worlds like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/defi\/\">finance<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/nfts\/\">art<\/a>, threatening existing orders and pointing toward a future defined by alternative currencies and digital collectibles. Those trends are bound to converge sooner rather than later, and in some corners of the social internet, it\u2019s already beginning to show.<\/p>\n<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/houseparty\/\">Houseparty founder Ben Rubin<\/a>, now working on a new company called <a href=\"https:\/\/slashtalk.com\/\">Slashtalk<\/a>, delved into some of those intersections. Rubin created Meerkat, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/27\/the-livestream-goes-mainstream\/\">the darling social app of SXSW 2015<\/a>, which later evolved into a spontaneous video chat app known as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/11\/21\/the-internet-third-place\/\">Houseparty<\/a>. Epic Games <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/12\/fortnite-maker-epic-acquires-social-video-app-houseparty\/\">bought Houseparty<\/a> in 2019, but Rubin\u2019s prescience for emerging social trends didn\u2019t stop there.<\/p>\n<p>These days, everyone seems to be abuzz about decentralization. As with any nascent tech trend on the horizon, a lot of jargon gets thrown around. Within the DeFi (decentralized finance) and NFT (non-fungible token) communities, Web3 is the term du jour that captures the revolutionary potential that decentralized networks hold for the future of the internet.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>After a decade of a handful of social media companies trading what are essentially publishing tools in exchange for serving us all an endless deluge of ads, the winds of change are finally blowing.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":113760560,"featured_media":2205200,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"3157c430-030f-3001-acc1-b55422d75e43"},"categories":[576602837,576601119,3457,17396],"tags":[9952980,64575263,576596953,284712,576697154,576697041,576923482,25473327,338337,576858976,36117,4808,576862436,576921400,576608613],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796352],"tc_event":[576832191],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/ben-rubin-disrupt.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/3une7TM","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.26,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","editorialContentProvider":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":{"ad":{"display":true,"title":"It's not too late to join!

(&#8220;Unlike Airkit, we see this rather as an expansion into organizations and not as an entry,&#8221; it suggests.)<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>It also reckons chatbot interfaces &#8212; while having their place &#8212; are better suited to customer support rather than its target zone of customer conversion, not being &#8220;optimized for converting traffic into signups, leads and sales&#8221;, as it puts it.<\/p>\n<p>While, on Heyflow vs Typeform, it suggests its product is more customizable &#8212; and also flags that it bakes in analytics and tracking, touting that as another detail which helps its customers build &#8220;truly differentiated experiences&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>The 2020-founded startup sells its SaaS as a subscription &#8212; not freemium but there is a free trial period of the basic version, which normally costs \u20ac33 per month (rising to \u20ac151 per month for a Pro Plus version).<\/p>\n<p>The promise of being able to integrate these &#8216;engaging clickflows&#8217; without needing to type a single line of code means Heyflow can and is (mostly) being used as a standalone solution, per the startup &#8212; which says that gives customers access to &#8220;more complex layout-ing functionality&#8221; (such as nested containers).<\/p>\n<p>But the team confirmed it can also be integrated into a website by copying and pasting a few lines of code.<\/p>\n<p>The founders are Dustin Jaacks (ex-Google) and Amir Bohnenkamp (previously Medwing, BCG Digital Ventures).<\/p>\n<p>Since Heyflow soft-launched its product in January this year they say they&#8217;ve seen &#8220;rapid growth&#8221;, acquiring &#8220;hundreds&#8221; of paying customers &#8212; from small organizations to insurance companies in more than 15 countries.<\/p>\n<p>The seed raise will go on supporting go-to-market and product development efforts, it adds.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We were able to convert our first customers pre-product. So from day one, we are developing the product with our customers which means building and selling for us go hand in hand. The new funding will therefore be equally invested into product and growth following a vertical approach, starting with the industries that are currently driving most growth for us,&#8221; Heyflow tells TechCrunch, adding that the markets and sectors currently driving their growth are: Insurance, Financial Services, Recruiting, Marketing &amp; Advertising (with use-cases including: Onboarding and Signup Flows; Lead Generation Flows; Customer Retention Flows).<\/p>\n<p>Commenting on the seed round in a supporting statement, Dr. Anton Waitz, general partner at Project A, added: \u201cNo-code platforms are seeing very strong momentum, as they offer great opportunities for smaller companies without significant engineering capacity. Amir and Dustin are driven by their mission to build a highly intuitive drag and drop product that helps their users to better acquire, convert and onboard customers. Heyflow has seen enthusiastic first demand in the market &#8211; and we strongly believe it can become a clear leader in the space.\u201d<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Heyflow, a Hamburg, Germany-based startup touting &#8216;no code&#8217; tools for easily building interactive &#8220;clickflows&#8221; to boost customer conversions, has bagged a $6 million seed.

Index Ventures and Point Nine. When your company is facing an outage or a data breach, Incident.io provides the right framework to communicate about the issue \u2014 both internally and externally \u2014 and make sure it is resolved as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to Index Ventures and Point Nine, several business angels are also investing in the company, such as Monzo founders Tom Blomfield and Jonas Templestein, Eileen Burbidge of Passion Capital, Renaud Visage, the co-founder of Eventbrite, as well as some clients, such as Hiroki Takeuchi of GoCardless and Vinay Hiremath of Loom.<\/p>\n<p>Incident.io starts with a deep integration with Slack. Many teams have to deal with multiple tools. They track an outage on one service and then talk about it with the rest of the team in Slack. That seems inefficient and leads to information disparity.<\/p>\n<p>With Incident.io, everything happens in Slack. Incidents are announced in a Slack channel so that people can get notified when something happens. People can create incidents with a <code><\/code><code>\/incident<\/code><code><\/code> shortcut.<\/p>\n<p>After that, Incident.io automatically creates a separate channel about the specific issue with the current date. Once again, you can interact with the service from the chat box in Slack or click on buttons. For instance, you can assign an issue to someone, add a summary, escalate the issue and more.<\/p>\n<p>And because it\u2019s a Slack channel, people can discuss the issue in that channel as well. This way, all information remains available in the same place. When you add people to an ongoing incident, they receive a summary from Incident.io so that they don\u2019t have to ask unnecessary questions.<\/p>\n<p>That information isn\u2019t just restricted to Slack. Customers get their own Incident.io dashboard with a list of incidents. Each incident gets its own page with participants, a timeline of events. For instance, GitHub pull requests are automatically added to these timelines.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>You can leverage this information to create a post-mortem post, share it with the team or your customers. Essentially, companies using Incident.io likely handle issues more gracefully and are more transparent about those issues. It should lead to a better experience for both team members and customers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Incident.io has raised a $4.7 million funding round led by Index Ventures and Point Nine.

Fidelity and B Capital Group co-led the new financing round, bringing the startup\u2019s all-time raise to over $1 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Prosus Ventures, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Facebook, and Good Capital also participated in the new round, which didn\u2019t involve any secondary transaction, the startup\u2019s co-founder and chief executive Vidit Aatrey told TechCrunch in an interview.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/meesho.com\">Meesho<\/a> &#8212; which counts Sequoia Capital India, Y Combinator, and Elevation Capital among its earliest investors &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/11\/meesho-india\/\">operates a three-sided marketplace<\/a> that connects suppliers (manufacturers and distributors) and resellers with customers on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram. The resellers buy listed products from the suppliers and make commission on each transaction when they sell to customers.<\/p>\n<p>About 80% of resellers on the platform are women, said Aatrey, who co-founded Meesho with Sanjeev Barnwal in 2015. From the beginning, the startup has aimed to help women start their business without need for any capital.<\/p>\n<p>The two engineers got the insight to start Meesho after spotting that merchants in India were always in touch with their customers on WhatsApp and shared information about new inventories. Some recounted that WhatsApp was driving 30% to 50% of their sales <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/08\/17\/meesho-wants-to-make-selling-through-whatsapp-more-efficient-and-less-painful\/\">even as the workflow was clumsy<\/a>. (WhatsApp has amassed over half a billion users in India. Nearly every user in the country with a smartphone uses the Facebook-owned service.)<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we started in 2015, what was mostly available online was branded products that were being sold to tier 1 customers,\u201d he said, adding that mostly smartphones, other electronics items and branded fashion products were popular then. \u201cEverything else was primarily offline.\u201d<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>\u201cIndia is primarily an unorganized market; 80 to 85% of the entire retail GDP is unstructured and long-tail and run by small businesses. But what had gone online at the time was the exact opposite of it,\u201d he said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOur mission has been to democratize internet commerce for everyone, including consumers, our Meesho entrepreneurs and small businesses. And I think that\u2019s our space: we will continue to focus on small businesses and on the demand side, we will continue to focus on the next billion customers.\u201d<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2210291\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2210291\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2210291\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/meesho-founders.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/meesho-founders.jpg 1500w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/meesho-founders.jpg?resize=150,100 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/meesho-founders.jpg?resize=300,200 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/meesho-founders.jpg?resize=768,512 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/meesho-founders.jpg?resize=680,453 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/meesho-founders.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2210291\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Meesho founders.<strong> Image Credits:<\/strong> Meesho<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s not to say the startup immediately found success. In the beginning, an early investor in Meesho recalled, Aatrey used to package and make deliveries himself. But things have changed dramatically over the years.<\/p>\n<p>As of April this year, 13 million entrepreneurs and over 100,000 suppliers were using Meesho. Aatrey declined to share new figures, but said \u201cwe have grown 3x since the previous fundraise.\u201d Meesho, which like other e-commerce firms was severely impacted by the first wave of the pandemic last year, has fully recovered.<\/p>\n<p>He added that the startup has become a complete \u201chorizontal player, where customers are buying from every category, including fashion, lifestyle, personal care, electronics and accessories, and automotive.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Meesho expanded to the grocery category, and Aatrey said the startup is making fast inroads in the space. The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital in part to broaden its research and development efforts and it hopes to increase its team by three times in the next 18 months, he said. It has set an ambitious goal to reach 100 million transacting users by the end of next year.<\/p>\n<p>At stake is the world\u2019s second-largest internet market, where e-commerce has hardly made any dent to the overall retail. Just the social commerce market is expected to be worth up to $20 billion in value by 2025, up from about $1 billion to $1.5 billion last year, analysts at Bernstein said earlier this week.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSocial commerce has the ability to empower more than 40 million small entrepreneurs across India.

helps your team communicate better during outages"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><a href=\"https:\/\/incident.io\">Incident.io<\/a> has raised a $4.7 million funding round led by Index Ventures and Point Nine. When your company is facing an outage or a data breach, Incident.io provides the right framework to communicate about the issue \u2014 both internally and externally \u2014 and make sure it is resolved as quickly as possible.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to Index Ventures and Point Nine, several business angels are also investing in the company, such as Monzo founders Tom Blomfield and Jonas Templestein, Eileen Burbidge of Passion Capital, Renaud Visage, the co-founder of Eventbrite, as well as some clients, such as Hiroki Takeuchi of GoCardless and Vinay Hiremath of Loom.<\/p>\n<p>Incident.io starts with a deep integration with Slack. Many teams have to deal with multiple tools. They track an outage on one service and then talk about it with the rest of the team in Slack. That seems inefficient and leads to information disparity.<\/p>\n<p>With Incident.io, everything happens in Slack. Incidents are announced in a Slack channel so that people can get notified when something happens. People can create incidents with a <code><\/code><code>\/incident<\/code><code><\/code> shortcut.<\/p>\n<p>After that, Incident.io automatically creates a separate channel about the specific issue with the current date. Once again, you can interact with the service from the chat box in Slack or click on buttons. For instance, you can assign an issue to someone, add a summary, escalate the issue and more.<\/p>\n<p>And because it\u2019s a Slack channel, people can discuss the issue in that channel as well. This way, all information remains available in the same place. When you add people to an ongoing incident, they receive a summary from Incident.io so that they don\u2019t have to ask unnecessary questions.<\/p>\n<p>That information isn\u2019t just restricted to Slack. Customers get their own Incident.io dashboard with a list of incidents. Each incident gets its own page with participants, a timeline of events. For instance, GitHub pull requests are automatically added to these timelines.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>You can leverage this information to create a post-mortem post, share it with the team or your customers. Essentially, companies using Incident.io likely handle issues more gracefully and are more transparent about those issues. It should lead to a better experience for both team members and customers.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Incident.io has raised a $4.7 million funding round led by Index Ventures and Point Nine.

So from day one, we are developing the product with our customers which means building and selling for us go hand in hand. The new funding will therefore be equally invested into product and growth following a vertical approach, starting with the industries that are currently driving most growth for us,&#8221; Heyflow tells TechCrunch, adding that the markets and sectors currently driving their growth are: Insurance, Financial Services, Recruiting, Marketing &amp; Advertising (with use-cases including: Onboarding and Signup Flows; Lead Generation Flows; Customer Retention Flows).<\/p>\n<p>Commenting on the seed round in a supporting statement, Dr. Anton Waitz, general partner at Project A, added: \u201cNo-code platforms are seeing very strong momentum, as they offer great opportunities for smaller companies without significant engineering capacity. Amir and Dustin are driven by their mission to build a highly intuitive drag and drop product that helps their users to better acquire, convert and onboard customers.

Berkeley finds gig workers could earn $4.82 per hour if MA ballot proposal passes"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">A coalition of app-based delivery and ride-hail companies like Uber, Lyft and DoorDash recently<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/03\/gig-companies-take-worker-classification-fight-to-massachusetts-through-ballot-initiative\/\"> filed a ballot proposition in Massachusetts<\/a> to continue classifying gig economy workers as independent contractors, rather than employees. If the measure makes it to the November 2022 ballot and passes, drivers could end up earning as little as a quarter of the minimum wage, <a href=\"https:\/\/laborcenter.berkeley.edu\/mass-uber-lyft-ballot-proposition-would-create-subminimum-wage\/\">according to a University of California-Berkeley study<\/a> published on Wednesday.<\/p>\n<p>The UC Berkeley Labor Center researchers, Ken Jacobs and Michael Reich, identified multiple loopholes that would change the guaranteed pay from $18 per hour to $4.82 for a typical 15-hour week driver and $6.74 per hour for a typical 40-hour week driver receiving a health stipend. The MA Coalition for Independent Work, the group responsible for the initiative, claimed UC Berkeley was pushing &#8220;false and misleading information about the ballot question that are not only at odds with the facts, but don&#8217;t stand up to scrutiny when compared with the success of Prop 22 in California,&#8221; according to a statement released by the coalition.<\/p>\n<p>The MA initiative, which was recently <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/01\/massachussetts-ag-greenlights-uber-lyft-backed-gig-worker-ballot-initiative\/\">given the green light<\/a> to start collecting signatures needed to get it on the ballot, is modeled after Proposition 22 in California. Prop 22 passed in November 2020, but in August<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/20\/californias-gig-worker-prop-22-ruled-unconstitutional-by-superior-court\/\"> a superior court judge ruled the law unconstitutional<\/a>, a decision that will very likely be appealed.<\/p>\n<p>As with Prop 22, the disagreement between advocates and opponents of the MA proposal comes down to the definition of &#8220;engaged time&#8221; and whether drivers have the right to earn pay outside of those hours. Engaged time is defined as the time when drivers are actively engaged in a gig, like when a delivery driver is driving to pick up food and drop it off. The proposed initiative would guarantee drivers an earnings floor equal to 120% of the MA minimum wage, which would be about $18 per hour in 2023 before customer tips, but only while drivers are actively engaged in a gig. It is this type of calculation that<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/02\/doordash-workers-protest-outside-ceo-tony-xus-home-demanding-better-pay-tip-transparency-and-ppe\/\"> DoorDash drivers who recently protested outside the home of CEO Tony Xu<\/a> said leads to inadequate pay.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Much of the drivers&#8217; time between paying rides is spent driving and cruising,&#8221; wrote Jacobs and Reich. &#8220;Drivers may be returning from a low demand drop off site to an area where they are more likely to pick up a ride, or they may be circling in downtown areas where there is no place to park.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Uber\u2019s own data indicate that engaged time amounts to only 67% of the drivers\u2019 actual working time,&#8221; the researchers continued. &#8220;The companies would not pay for the approximately <a href=\"https:\/\/drive.google.com\/file\/d\/1FIUskVkj9lsAnWJQ6kLhAhNoVLjfFdx3\/view\">33 percent<\/a> of the time that drivers are waiting between passengers or returning from trips to outlying areas. But such time is a necessary part of drivers\u2019 work&#8230; Not paying for that time would be the equivalent of a fast-food restaurant or retail store paying the cashier only when a customer is at the counter. We have labor and employment laws precisely to protect workers from this kind of exploitation.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/uber-under-the-hood\/unpacking-pay-standards-a-response-to-the-uc-berkeley-labor-center-aa5549871040\">Uber has said<\/a> drivers could have the app on while rejecting or ignoring dispatches, completing trips for other apps or just running errands, and essentially shouldn&#8217;t be paid for that time.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>The proposed ballot question would also guarantee drivers at least $0.26 per mile to cover the cost of vehicle upkeep and gas, according to the coalition. Jacobs and Reich found that not only is this $0.30 less than the IRS reimbursement rate, but it also, again, only accounts for the time a driver is &#8220;active,&#8221; which means drivers wouldn&#8217;t be reimbursed for vehicle costs accrued in between rides. Using Uber&#8217;s studies, the researchers found 6.6 of the miles driven each hour incur costs that would not be reimbursed under the ballot proposal.<\/p>\n<p>Also included in the coalition&#8217;s proposal are a series of new benefits including paid sick time, paid family and medical leave, occupational accident insurance and healthcare stipends for those who work at least 15 hours per week. In some cases, a company may require a driver to also submit proof of current enrollment in a qualifying health plan in order to be eligible for the stipend. Most drivers do spend an average of 15 hours per week on the app, say the researchers, but since a third of that time is spent unengaged, a driver would actually have to work 22. hours to be eligible for the stipend. Finding drivers who work those hours and already have insurance coverage would rule out the majority of drivers from qualifying for health stipends, according to Jacobs and Reich.<\/p>\n<p>Finally, because independent contractors are required to pay both employer and employee shares of payroll taxes, drivers would end up having to pay up to 11.8% of their total income, another cost which app-based companies are not offsetting with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mass.gov\/doc\/21-11-a-law-defining-and-regulating-the-contract-based-relationship-between-network-companies-and-app-based-drivers-version-a\/download\">current language<\/a> of their proposal.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese numbers are completely ridiculous &#8211; I wouldn\u2019t be doing this job if I wasn\u2019t making well above minimum wage,\u201d said Luis Ramos, a Lyft driver from Worcester, in a statement from the MA Coalition for Independent Work. \u201cEvery driver I know prefers this work because they make good money and they do it whenever they want for however long they want.

Thursday it has raised $570 million in its Series F financing round, following <a

Fidelity and B Capital Group co-led the new financing round, bringing the startup\u2019s all-time raise to over $1 billion.<\/p>\n<p>Prosus Ventures, SoftBank Vision Fund 2, Facebook, and Good Capital also participated in the new round, which didn\u2019t involve any secondary transaction, the startup\u2019s co-founder and chief executive Vidit Aatrey told TechCrunch in an interview.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/meesho.com\">Meesho<\/a> &#8212; which counts Sequoia Capital India, Y Combinator, and Elevation Capital among its earliest investors &#8212; <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/08\/11\/meesho-india\/\">operates a three-sided marketplace<\/a> that connects suppliers (manufacturers and distributors) and resellers with customers on social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook and Instagram.

From the beginning, the startup has aimed to help women start their business without need for any capital.<\/p>\n<p>The two engineers got the insight to start Meesho after spotting that merchants in India were always in touch with their customers on WhatsApp and shared information about new inventories. Some recounted that WhatsApp was driving 30% to 50% of their sales <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/08\/17\/meesho-wants-to-make-selling-through-whatsapp-more-efficient-and-less-painful\/\">even as the workflow was clumsy<\/a>.

In the beginning, an early investor in Meesho recalled, Aatrey used to package and make deliveries himself. But things have changed dramatically over the years.<\/p>\n<p>As of April this year, 13 million entrepreneurs and over 100,000 suppliers were using Meesho. Aatrey declined to share new figures, but said \u201cwe have grown 3x since the previous fundraise.\u201d Meesho, which like other e-commerce firms was severely impacted by the first wave of the pandemic last year, has fully recovered.<\/p>\n<p>He added that the startup has become a complete \u201chorizontal player, where customers are buying from every category, including fashion, lifestyle, personal care, electronics and accessories, and automotive.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Earlier this year, Meesho expanded to the grocery category, and Aatrey said the startup is making fast inroads in the space. The startup plans to deploy the fresh capital in part to broaden its research and development efforts and it hopes to increase its team by three times in the next 18 months, he said. It has set an ambitious goal to reach 100 million transacting users by the end of next year.<\/p>\n<p>At stake is the world\u2019s second-largest internet market, where e-commerce has hardly made any dent to the overall retail. Just the social commerce market is expected to be worth up to $20 billion in value by 2025, up from about $1 billion to $1.5 billion last year, analysts at Bernstein said earlier this week.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSocial commerce has the ability to empower more than 40 million small entrepreneurs across India.

Rubin explains why the Web3 era of social media will help everybody get paid"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">After a decade<\/span> of a handful of dominant social media companies trading what are essentially publishing tools in exchange for serving us all an endless deluge of ads, the winds of change are finally blowing \u2014 in a few different directions at once.<\/p>\n<p>Content creators (arguably either a special echelon of influencers or anyone who posts online) are slowly siphoning off some of the power that social media companies have wielded for years. Meanwhile, decentralization is sweeping worlds like <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/defi\/\">finance<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/nfts\/\">art<\/a>, threatening existing orders and pointing toward a future defined by alternative currencies and digital collectibles. Those trends are bound to converge sooner rather than later, and in some corners of the social internet, it\u2019s already beginning to show.<\/p>\n<p>At TechCrunch Disrupt 2021 last week, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/tag\/houseparty\/\">Houseparty founder Ben Rubin<\/a>, now working on a new company called <a href=\"https:\/\/slashtalk.com\/\">Slashtalk<\/a>, delved into some of those intersections. Rubin created Meerkat, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2015\/03\/27\/the-livestream-goes-mainstream\/\">the darling social app of SXSW 2015<\/a>, which later evolved into a spontaneous video chat app known as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2016\/11\/21\/the-internet-third-place\/\">Houseparty<\/a>. Epic Games <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2019\/06\/12\/fortnite-maker-epic-acquires-social-video-app-houseparty\/\">bought Houseparty<\/a> in 2019, but Rubin\u2019s prescience for emerging social trends didn\u2019t stop there.<\/p>\n<p>These days, everyone seems to be abuzz about decentralization. As with any nascent tech trend on the horizon, a lot of jargon gets thrown around.

Crunch for September 29, 2021. Welcome to what feels like fall on the East Coast of the United States. Yes, the seasons are changing, but the technology and startup worlds are refusing to shift from the high-velocity pace that they\u2019ve held for what feels like years at this point. Someone should tell them to drink hot tea by a window looking out at trees for a few days instead of doing, well, all that follows in this letter. &#8212; <a href=\"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alex\">Alex<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>The TechCrunch Top 3<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Google announces slew of search updates: <\/strong>Alphabet company Google is the world leader on search, but with competition <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/12\/can-you-beat-google-with-googles-brains\/\">starting to nip at its heels<\/a>, the company is busy rolling out upgrades to its tech. Today the company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/google-is-redesigning-search-using-a-i-technologies-and-new-features\/\">announced some redesign work<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/google-beefs-up-wildfire-tracking-tree-cover-and-plus-codes-in-maps\/\">better wildfire tracking<\/a> and an effort to <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/google-search-update-will-provide-more-context-about-websites-including-descriptions-and-what-others-say\/\">bake more context into results<\/a>. All of that is welcome, but doesn\u2019t cut at the core issue of rising ad loads on prime search real estate.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Direct listings are hot:<\/strong> Recent public-market debuts <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/what-amplitudes-direct-listing-says-about-ipo-pops-and-how-startups-can-avoid-them\/\">from Amplitude<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/warby-parker-makes-it-clear-that-direct-listings-are-unicorn-friendly\/\">Warby Parker<\/a> indicate that the direct-listing route to public-market liquidity is more than open today. For unicorns perhaps uncomfortable with the traditional IPO, it\u2019s more than good news.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/softbank-sinks-200m-into-andela-propels-company-into-unicorn-territory\/\"><strong>SoftBank pours $200M into Andela:<\/strong><\/a> While Tiger is making the largest media waves these days, SoftBank is still busy doing deals. Today the Japanese telco and investing powerhouse announced a deal to put several hundred million dollars into Andela, a startup that connects tech talent from Africa with companies elsewhere in the world. The round fits neatly in the talent crunch narrative we\u2019ve heard so much about from companies in recent quarters and greater global respect for Africa\u2019s tech scene <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/07\/27\/african-startups-join-global-funding-boom-as-fintech-shines\/\">that we\u2019re seeing in venture capital results as well<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Startups\/VC<\/h2>\n<p>Before we get into our general startup news roundup, let\u2019s talk climate. Earlier this week TechCrunch put together a deep dive into <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/27\/the-enormous-challenges-and-abundant-opportunities-in-climate-tech\/\">the huge opportunities for startups working on climate-related issues<\/a>, efforts that could improve the world<em> and<\/em> make piles of money. Today\u2019s news really underscores the point.<\/p>\n<p>Today on TechCrunch we learned <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/droneseeds-36m-a-round-makes-it-a-one-stop-shop-for-post-wildfire-reforestation\/\">about DroneSeed\u2019s $36 million round<\/a> that could help with habitat restoration post-wildfire; how climate volatility <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/climate-volatility-helps-agtech-platform-semios-raise-100m-round-led-by-morningside\/\">helped agtech startup Semios land $100 million<\/a>; and that two new funds (<a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/investible-launches-100m-aud-fund-for-early-stage-climate-tech-startups\/\">Investible with AUD$100 million<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/energize-ventures-raises-330m-to-fund-energy-mobility-and-climate-resiliency-technology\/\">Energize Ventures with $330 million<\/a>) are also looking at the climate-tech space.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s quite the thematic bundle.

There are a host of startups building for a space-friendly future in which in-space servicing is going to really matter. Starfish just raised $7 million for its work on building space tugs. Which are like tug boats, but smaller, and in orbit. Space tugs! That rules!<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/tonic-ai-raises-35m-series-b-to-help-engineers-create-synthetic-data-sets\/\"><strong>Tonic.ai raises $35M:<\/strong><\/a><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Today from the enterprise beat, Tonic just raised a huge grip of cash to grow its service that helps provide engineers with synthetic data sets. What are those? Per TechCrunch, it\u2019s \u201cproduction-like data\u201d that they can use for testing without annoying regulators both inside and outside their companies. So it\u2019s like lorem ipsum, but for even bigger nerds than lorem ipsum is for, I suppose.<\/li>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/employee-leave-startup-cocoon-launches-after-raising-20m-in-new-funding\/\"><strong>Cocoon raises $20M, wins prize in our hearts for having a good name:<\/strong><\/a><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Cocoon is building a platform to help employees and employers alike better understand and manage leave.

(Incidentally, as someone who was on the ground there during the flight, I can&#8217;t help but feel a little alarmed in retrospect.)<\/p>\n<p>For future flights, Virgin Galactic will reserve more airspace to accommodate the potential for anomalous trajectories like this one.

foundational concepts of business. In the digital age, companies have learned much about their customers by forming individual profiles from third-party cookies, social content, purchased demographics and more. But in the face of growing demands for privacy, businesses have the opportunity to overhaul their relationship with customer data to focus solely on first-party data and patterns of behavior.<\/p>\n<p>Companies have employed digital analytics, advertising and marketing solutions to track customers and connect their behaviors across touch points. This enabled the creation of data profiles, which have been leveraged to deliver personalized experiences that resonate through relevance and context.<\/p>\n<p>Now, however, this practice of profiling and identifying customers is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Regulators are adopting new data and consumer privacy legislation, most recently seen with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jdsupra.com\/legalnews\/2021-colorado-privacy-act-passes-and-4993635\/\">Colorado Privacy Act<\/a>. Moreover, Apple\u2019s privacy implementations in iOS 14.8 and iOS 15 have been adopted by <a href=\"https:\/\/mashable.com\/article\/ios-14-5-users-opt-out-of-ad-tracking\/\">an estimated 96% of users<\/a>, who have opted to stop apps from tracking their activity for ad targeting. And Google has announced it will no longer support third-party cookies and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnet.com\/news\/google-will-stop-selling-ads-based-on-tracked-individual-browsing-history\/\">will stop tracking on an individual basis altogether through its Chrome browser<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>While these developments threaten to upend how digital marketing is performed today, they signal a necessary, and effective, shift in the ways brands will understand their customers in the future. Prioritizing individual profiles is far from the fastest or most effective way to understand and address customers\u2019 intentions, needs and struggles. Brands don\u2019t need to know who; they need to know what and why.<\/p>\n<p>Thanks to rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), companies can process and interpret first-party data in real time and develop actionable behavioral intelligence.<\/p>\n<h2>Pattern analysis as a way forward<\/h2>\n<p>The security industry, which I\u2019ve been involved in for 35 years, provides a template for the path forward. Historically, security professionals have sought to pinpoint individuals\u2019 signatures in order to identify, thwart or at least prosecute bad actors. However, the last few years have marked the rise of some incredibly promising companies and approaches that leverage patterns of signals to proactively surface and stop threats before they happen.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Prioritizing individual profiles is far from the most effective way to understand and address customers\u2019 intentions, needs and struggles.

Warby has long had a strong e-commerce component, though it has a growing retail footprint to support its digital sales efforts.<\/p>\n<p>Warby&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/25\/d2c-specs-purveyor-warby-parker-files-to-go-public\/\">direct listing<\/a> has proved a success. The company not only listed, but did so at a price point that was above its final private-market valuation, and its shares appreciated rapidly during its first day of trading. For the DTC market, the results partially combat the odor that <a href=\"https:\/\/news.crunchbase.com\/news\/casper-stock-falls-below-ipo-price-on-second-day-of-trading\/\">2020&#8217;s ill-fated Casper IPO<\/a> left lingering around the startup business model category.<\/p>\n<p>Before we close the books on direct-listing week, a few quick thoughts on the Warby listing. I found a few healthy things in the debut, and one that&#8217;s ever so slightly less sanative. Let&#8217;s have some fun!<\/p>\n<h2>Good news for DTC startups<\/h2>\n<p>In the wake of Casper&#8217;s underpowered and rapidly descending public offering, DTC startups got a bit of a bad rap. Rising channel advertising costs biting more deeply into customer acquisition costs while software revenue multiples scaled to new heights thanks to the pandemic and an accelerating digital transformation made the model of actually making physical goods and selling them to consumers seem a bit old hat.<div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Warby Parker not only listed, but did so at a price point that was above its final private-market valuation, and its shares appreciated rapidly during its first day of trading.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":428363,"featured_media":1606457,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"outcome":"","status":"","crunchbase_tag":0,"amp_status":"","relegenceEntities":[],"relegenceSubjects":[],"carmot_uuid":"e6486ea8-fe4f-3b19-b72d-3c4284b1dc9f"},"categories":[11160,60523764,20429],"tags":[345071,576790618,576625676,576845137,449557042,31902984],"crunchbase_tag":[],"tc_stories_tax":[],"tc_ec_category":[576796353,576796356],"tc_event":[],"jetpack_featured_media_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/warby-parker.jpg","shortlink":"https:\/\/tcrn.ch\/2Wp5god","rapidData":{"pt":"","pct":""},"premiumContent":true,"premiumCutoffPercent":0.32,"featured":false,"subtitle":"","seoTitle":"","editorialContentProvider":"","seoDescription":"","tc_cb_mapping":[],"associatedEvent":null,"event":null,"authors":[1461024],"hide_featured_image":false,"canonical_url":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/29\/warby-parker-makes-it-clear-that-direct-listings-are-unicorn-friendly\/","_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2210120"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2210120"}],"version-history":[{"count":7,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2210120\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2210269,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/2210120\/revisions\/2210269"}],"authors":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/guest-authors\/alex-wilhelm"}],"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/edit":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-admin\/post.php?post=2210120&action=edit"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/tc\/v1\/users\/428363"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/1606457"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2210120"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=2210120"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=2210120"},{"taxonomy":"_tc_cb_tag_taxonomy","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/crunchbase_tag?post=2210120"},{"taxonomy":"tc_stories_tax","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_stories_tax?post=2210120"},{"taxonomy":"tc_ec_category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_ec_category?post=2210120"},{"taxonomy":"tc_event","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tc_event?post=2210120"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]},"_embedded":{"authors":[{"id":1461024,"name":"Alex Wilhelm","link":"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/alex-wilhelm\/","description":"Alex Wilhelm is the editor-in-chief of <a href=\"http:\/\/www.crunchbase.news\">Crunchbase News<\/a> and co-host of <a href=\"https:\/\/itunes.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/equity\/id1215439780?mt=2\">Equity<\/a>, TechCrunch's venture capital-focused podcast.","slug":"alex-wilhelm","links":{"facebook":"http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/alex.wilhelm","twitter":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/alex","linkedin":"http:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/alexwilhelm\/","homepage":"","crunchbase":"https:\/\/www.crunchbase.com\/person\/alex-wilhelm"},"position":"Contributor","cbDescription":"<p>Alex Wilhelm is Senior Editor at TechCrunch.

Earlier this year, the video platform began <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/08\/24\/tiktok-expands-shopify-partnership-pilots-tiktok-shopping-in-us-uk-and-canada\/\">piloting TikTok Shopping<\/a> in the U.S., U.K. and Canada, in partnership with Shopify. The deal allowed Shopify merchants with a TikTok For Business account to add a Shopping tab to their TikTok profiles and sync their product catalogs to the app to create mini-storefronts. Now, TikTok is announcing a slate of new brand partners for TikTok Shopping, including Square, Ecwid and PrestaShop, with Wix, SHOPLINE, OpenCart and BASE coming soon. It also introduced a fuller slate of solutions for TikTok commerce, including ad products and later this year, a TikTok Shopping API.<\/p>\n<p>The company detailed its further plans for TikTok Shopping at an online event called TikTok World on Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p>Here, TikTok shared how popular commerce had become on its platform. For example, it noted that the #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt hashtag &#8212; which users post when sharing products they had discovered through TikTok videos &#8212; has grown to include 4.6 billion views and is still climbing. The company also touted how well its video could push users from product awareness to action, claiming that, compared with competitors, TikTok users are 1.7 times more likely to have purchased products through the app, citing a survey conducted by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.materialplus.io\/\">Material<\/a> in August 2021.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2210143\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2210143\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2210143\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"379\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg 3326w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=150,84 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=300,167 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=768,428 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=680,379 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=1536,856 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=2048,1142 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/tiktok-shop-tab.jpg?resize=50,28 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2210143\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> TikTok Shopping<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The company said it&#8217;s able to work with online merchants in a couple of different ways.

Each card can feature a different product for sale and, when tapped, brings users to a fast-loading instant gallery page where TikTok users can browse items and make a purchase. This type of ad can be used to drive traffic to a merchant&#8217;s website, and can be particularly useful for things like limited-time deals, seasonal sales and recent launches. TikTok cited one case study with a brand called Princess Polly which saw a 6x return on ad spend and an over 50% increase on overall product page visits with the ad.<\/p>\n<p>Dynamic Showcase Ads are another new product, and allow brands to promote thousands (or even millions) of product SKUs via personalized video ads. DSA will generate video ads that target specific audiences based on their interests and commerce activities, such as adding items to a cart or viewing a product. TikTok has created a suite of DSA templates that follow the platform&#8217;s creative principles of offering creative clips with music and text overlays. TikTok claims early DSA tests indicate the templates are driving higher click-through rates and conversion rates for advertisers but didn&#8217;t share metrics. On this effort, it&#8217;s partnered with video marketing company SHAKR, plus Productsup and feedonomics which can help integrate product catalogs.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2210161\" style=\"width: 581px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2210161\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2210161\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TikTok-DSA.jpg?w=571\" alt=\"\" width=\"571\" height=\"680\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TikTok-DSA.jpg 1578w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TikTok-DSA.jpg?resize=126,150 126w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TikTok-DSA.jpg?resize=252,300 252w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TikTok-DSA.jpg?resize=768,914 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TikTok-DSA.jpg?resize=571,680 571w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TikTok-DSA.jpg?resize=1291,1536 1291w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/TikTok-DSA.jpg?resize=42,50 42w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 571px) 100vw, 571px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2210161\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> TikTok (DSA)<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Lead Generation, meanwhile, continues to be available within in-feed video ads offering brands an easy way to collect information from TikTok users through online forms.

With Ultifi, they&#8217;re going to be defined by it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The platform will be built on top of the company\u2019s vehicle intelligence platform, or VIP, which is the underlying hardware architecture that provides greater data processing power. While vehicles equipped with VIP are already capable of over-the-air software updates, GM says Utlifi will enable faster updates by centralizing all the vehicle&#8217;s modules on a single platform.<\/p>\n<p>Ultifi will be integrated alongside Android Automotive, the OS embedded in some GM infotainment systems. (Android Automotive OS is separate from Android Auto, which is a secondary interface that lies on top of the operating system.) The difference between the two comes down to capability and availability: \u201cAndroid Automotive is a certain subset of functionality in the car,\u201d Miller explained. \u201cUltifi is more of an umbrella overall strategy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Like Android, Ultifi will be Linux-based, a widely used developer platform. Miller said GM chose Linux because \u201cat some point we really want to open this up\u201d to authorize third-party developers to launch in-car apps, Miller said.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Ultifi, which is still in development, will start rolling out in 2023 and will be available exclusively to those vehicles and beyond, due to the computing demands of the system. Customers can either purchase the vehicle or purchase different access plans, like how consumers purchase different plans for their smartphone, Miller said. That means varying prices and varying plans, though GM didn\u2019t go into any specifics. Nor did it disclose how much revenue it expects the new platform to generate.<\/p>\n<p>This is just the latest move by major automakers to make new vehicles more connected than ever before. Both General Motors and Ford have discussed the revenue-generating opportunities in software and subscription services, and Ultifi is another step toward building out those businesses.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe&#8217;re not transitioning away from vehicles,\u201d Miller said. \u201cWe&#8217;re expanding our business.

Once it opens next year, Greenhouse will bring together startups, researchers, academics and corporations, including climate tech companies outside of Investible\u2019s portfolio.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s about helping them go from startup to scale, and so some of that will be additional research to improve their technology or engaging corporates to understand what exactly they are looking for and also finding their next customers,\u201d said Tom Kline, one of the heads of the Climate Tech Fund.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"d7vPgjrKEq\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/14\/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation\/\">Canva raises $200 million at a $40 billion valuation<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Canva raises $200 million at a $40 billion valuation&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/14\/canva-raises-200-million-at-a-40-billion-valuation\/embed\/#?secret=d7vPgjrKEq\" data-secret=\"d7vPgjrKEq\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The fund will invest in seed rounds, but reserve half of its capital for follow-on funding. It will primarily back Australian companies, but also plans to devote up to 30% of the fund to international companies. It is focused on the six sectors <a href=\"https:\/\/www.unep.org\/interactive\/six-sector-solution-climate-change\/\">identified by the United Nations Environment Programme<\/a> as the most important for reducing climate change and global warming: energy, transport, industry, buildings and cities, food and agriculture, and forests and land use.<\/p>\n<p>The fund will be led by Kline, former chief executive officer of renewable energy manager <a href=\"https:\/\/www.newenergysolar.com.au\/\">New Energy Solar<\/a>, and Patrick Sieb, who has invested in tech companies since 2014 and focused specifically on climate tech startups since 2019.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWith each passing year, we\u2019re noticing that we need to do more in the space, and coming from the other end, Investible sees deal flow of between 1,500 to 2,000 a year, and an increasing amount of those have been climate focused,\u201d Kline told TechCrunch about the firm\u2019s decision to launch a climate-focused fund after being sector-agnostic.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>He added that more people are paying attention to climate change and it\u2019s driving consumer choices and prompting corporations to become more transparent. More governments are also setting targets that will require significant technology \u2014 and capital \u2014 to achieve.<\/p>\n<p>Investible\u2019s climate fund will typically participate in seed rounds starting from about $1.5 million AUD, contributing up to 30%, so about $500,000 AUD. Follow-on checks could be up to several million dollars.<\/p>\n<p>The fund will use the same investment process as Investible\u2019s sector-agnostic funds, but with climate-focused criteria.

maybe an O-1A). <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>Toward that goal, I\u2019ve been trying to get media coverage about my startup, but it\u2019s competitive out there! Any advice?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>\u2014 Craving Coverage<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Dear Craving,<\/p>\n<p>Thanks for reaching out! Yesterday was the <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/Sophie_Alcorn\/status\/1442942339903672321\">six-year anniversary<\/a> of my law firm, and shortly after I founded it, I set a personal challenge: to achieve the level of success that would qualify me (if I needed a U.S. green card) to meet the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/eb-1a-green-card\/\">EB-1A<\/a> criteria as a person of \u201cextraordinary ability.\u201d What right did I have to expect this of my clients if I couldn\u2019t achieve it myself?<\/p>\n<p>Starting from scratch (my kids were young, I had taken a multiyear career break, and I didn\u2019t have a network in Silicon Valley), it took me about two years to reach this level of success (and it was also a great marketing plan for my firm).<\/p>\n<p>So, I know this from experience: Achieving the level of success required for an EB-1A or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/o-1a-extraordinary-ability\/\">O-1A<\/a> is totally possible. And remember, you only need to meet at least three of the criteria to qualify!<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2100312\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2100312\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"breakout size-full wp-image-2100312\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg\" alt=\"A composite image of immigration law attorney Sophie Alcorn in front of a background with a TechCrunch logo.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"675\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg 1800w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=150,99 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=300,198 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=768,506 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=680,448 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=1536,1013 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/01\/Sophie-Alcorn-TechCrunch1-3.jpg?resize=50,33 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2100312\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Joanna Buniak \/ <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alcorn.law\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sophie Alcorn <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">(opens in a new window)<\/span><\/a><\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<h2>Offer your expertise<\/h2>\n<p>The key is to be strategic about getting media coverage. Know the audience of the trade publication or major media outlet where you\u2019re seeking coverage and figure out the type of stories that get their interest.<\/p>\n<p>Generally, reporters like to be the first to break news or to get an exclusive story, so consider offering a scoop about a significant multimillion-dollar deal involving your company or a story idea, such as an emerging trend in your field or a unique perspective on a big issue, to one reporter to start. If that reporter isn\u2019t interested, move on to another.<\/p>\n<p>One service that can help technology entrepreneurs is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ellisx.com\/\">EllisX<\/a>, which helps founders get coverage for their startups in articles and podcasts and secure speaking engagements. Or you can try to cultivate a relationship on your own with a journalist who writes about your field. Offer yourself as a resource to explain new developments or challenging issues in your field. I took this approach when I began working on meeting the EB-1A criteria, and I soon found myself being quoted as an expert on immigration in publications around the globe \u2014 and that led to me writing this <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/author\/sophie-alcorn\/\">weekly column<\/a>!<\/p>\n<p>Remember, for O-1A and EB-1A immigration purposes, newsletters and press releases that were never published in a major publication, as well as articles in student-run or university publications, usually don\u2019t count.<\/p>\n<p><div class=\"extra-crunch-offer-container\"><\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>I\u2019m an entrepreneur working on building up my qualifications for the EB-1A green card (or maybe an O-1A).

adds phone-verified chat, expands email authentication settings as users face &#8216;hate raids&#8217;"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Twitch announced today that it will add new channel-level security features to help curb harassment on the platform. Now, creators and moderators can enable verified chat, requiring chatters to validate their phone and\/or email before they can send messages. These settings can be toggled to enable verified chat for all accounts, first-time chatters, those under a certain account age or ones that haven&#8217;t been following the streamer for a chosen amount of time. These settings will be turned off by default until the channel opts in, and there are also settings to ensure that VIPs, subscribers and moderators can bypass verification. Unlike two-factor authentication, a user only needs to verify their phone or email once before they&#8217;re considered verified across all channels.<\/p>\n<p>Twitch users can link up to five accounts to the same phone number, but if one is banned from a channel, all accounts verified with that phone number or email address will be banned too. The intention is to prevent people from creating multiple hate accounts under one phone number or email, so the streamer just has to block someone once, rather than five times. On a sitewide level, if a phone-verified account is suspended, linked accounts will also be suspended. While it&#8217;s possible to simply use another phone number, like a Google Voice account, this adds an extra layer of difficulty for bad actors.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Tensions are high in the Twitch community as underrepresented creators, particularly those who are Black or LGTBQ+, are facing targeted harassment through Twitch&#8217;s raid system. Sometimes, when a streamer goes offline, they&#8217;ll surprise another streamer by sending their fans over to check out their channel in a &#8220;raid.&#8221; This feature is designed to help established streamers support up-and-comers. But over the past several months, bad actors have used the raid feature to send bots that spew targeted harassment at creators during their streams. Twitch told TechCrunch, however, that most of these mass targeted attacks aren&#8217;t actually facilitated through the raids tool, and that the platform views the phrasing as a colloquial misnomer.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In May, Twitch launched 350 new channel tags related to gender, sexual orientation, race and ability, which users <a href=\"https:\/\/twitch.uservoice.com\/forums\/310210-discover\/suggestions\/37011022-trans-tag-request\">requested<\/a> to discover more representative creators. But some people weaponized tags to target marginalized streamers, and Twitch didn&#8217;t have comprehensive enough tools to curb this harassment &#8212; some creators even developed their own <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/22633874\/how-to-stop-a-hate-raid-twitch-safety-tools\">home-brewed safety tools<\/a>, like a &#8220;panic button&#8221; that launches a series of chat commands. These streamers prompted Twitch to take action with the hashtag #TwitchDoBetter. Then, earlier this month, streamers like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/luciaeverblack\">LuciaEverblack<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/shineypen\">ShineyPen<\/a>\u00a0and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.twitch.tv\/rekitraven\">RekItRaven<\/a> (who started the tag), launched #ADayOffTwitch, a day-long boycott of the site.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"PfNq1hyjmf\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/01\/streamers-are-boycotting-twitch-today-to-protest-the-platforms-lack-of-action-on-hate-raids\/\">Streamers are boycotting Twitch today to protest the platform&#8217;s lack of action on &#8216;hate raids&#8217;<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Streamers are boycotting Twitch today to protest the platform&#8217;s lack of action on &#8216;hate raids&#8217;&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/01\/streamers-are-boycotting-twitch-today-to-protest-the-platforms-lack-of-action-on-hate-raids\/embed\/#?secret=PfNq1hyjmf\" data-secret=\"PfNq1hyjmf\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/01\/streamers-are-boycotting-twitch-today-to-protest-the-platforms-lack-of-action-on-hate-raids\/\">#ADayOffTwitch action<\/a> came with demands.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The #ADayOffTwitch action came with demands. Participating streamers wanted the ability to control incoming raids and asked Twitch to implement age restrictions, email signup limits and share a time frame for when comprehensive anti-harassment tools will be implemented. <\/span>Soon after, the platform <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/13\/twitch-hate-raids-lawsuits\/\">pursued legal action<\/a> against two users linked to thousands of bot accounts used for hate raids.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Today&#8217;s announcement helps address one of these demands, but in an email to TechCrunch, Twitch said that it has been developing, testing and refining phone-verified chat long before the hate raids became so frequent. Still, community feedback from <a href=\"https:\/\/twitch.uservoice.com\/forums\/933812-safety\">UserVoice<\/a> and its Ambassadors Discord also helped inspire these additions, and Twitch said in a <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.twitch.tv\/en\/2021\/09\/29\/securing-your-chat-with-phone-and-email-verification\/\">blog post<\/a> that it will roll out other channel-level ban-evasion tools soon. It also noted that streamers already have <a href=\"https:\/\/safety.twitch.tv\/s\/article\/Combating-Targeted-Attacks?language=en_US\">the option<\/a> to only accept raids from friends, teammates and followed channels. The service hasn&#8217;t made public its timelines for rolling out safety features, possibly because it can give bad actors more information about what Twitch is planning and how to evade it.<\/p>\n<p>Creators can access these new settings by navigating to <a href=\"https:\/\/dashboard.twitch.tv\/settings\/moderation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?q=https:\/\/dashboard.twitch.tv\/settings\/moderation&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1632943811939000&amp;usg=AFQjCNHyqqgC_Nh7AxsetNNuHCNnkRp3hg\">Dashboard \u2192 Settings \u2192 Moderation<\/a>.

That means, if you&#8217;re browsing a website and something catches your eye in a photograph, you can click to see where to buy the item in question. This sort of feature is an expansion of the existing Google Lens technology, which can already identify products in images.

with the goal of improving the media literacy of online users. The company is expanding the capabilities of its &#8220;About this Result&#8221; feature, launched earlier this year, to also now include information about the source itself, including its description from Wikipedia and what the site says about itself, as well as news, reviews and other context that can help people better evaluate unfamiliar or new sources. It will also point users to other information about the same topic, to point users to other sources of information that may be related to the user&#8217;s original query.<\/p>\n<p>The company <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/02\/01\/google-now-gives-you-more-information-about-the-sites-in-your-search-results\/\">introduced<\/a> &#8220;About this Result&#8221; in February to its search results in English in the U.S., with a short description pulled from Wikipedia, if available, when the site first came online, and if your connection to the website was secure, among other things.<\/p>\n<p>It will soon update this panel with more details. Instead of just a description of the site from Wikipedia, it will now also include what a website says about itself, in its own words. This information is pulled directly from the website, when available. Often, a site includes details about its authors, publishers or its purpose in an &#8220;about section&#8221; that introduces the website to new visitors. This information will now be extracted to enhance the &#8220;About the Source&#8221; panel with more details.<\/p>\n<p>Below this, Google will display when the site first came online &#8212; a piece of information that could help users identify websites that have sustained themselves over a longer period of time, versus newcomers that may have popped up more recently as part of recent misinformation or propaganda campaign.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2210071\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2210071\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2210071 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"372\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg 2822w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=150,82 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=300,164 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=768,420 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=680,372 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=1536,840 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1121 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.32.32-PM.jpg?resize=50,27 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2210071\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>Google will also connect users to more information about the source itself, as indexed across the web. Here, people can analyze what others are saying about the site in question, whether that&#8217;s news outlets, reviews, trusted organizations like the Better Business Bureau and more. This could help people learn what sort of reputation the website has online, as documented by other sources.<\/p>\n<p>The company clarifies this section of &#8220;others&#8221; will be based on Google Results from the open web, which identify pages that may give you context about the website. Google also attempts to prioritize the helpful results which are not created or controlled by the source website in order to provide independent perspectives, it says.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>In addition, Google will add an &#8220;About the Topic&#8221; feature that will point web searchers to more information about their original query, including top news coverage or other search results about that same subject. This could help people learn more about something they&#8217;re interested in.

or get on them in the first place. The company is improving wildfire tracking, expanding a tool for calculating tree canopy cover in cities and further automating virtual address creation with Plus Codes.<\/p>\n<p>The wildfires will be of the most immediate use to most users, since the once rare disaster has evolved into its own recurring season. Google put out <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.google\/products\/search\/mapping-wildfires-with-satellite-data\/\">a wildfire tracking tool last year<\/a> for people searching for those fires \u2014 so when you looked for &#8220;camp fire&#8221; or the like, it wouldn&#8217;t just serve news but a frequently updated info center complete with fire authorities&#8217; best guess at a live outline.<\/p>\n<p>Now that information is coming to the Maps app as a layer like traffic or bike paths. When you turn it on, any nearby fires will be marked on the map, and tapping one will bring up its live outline as of an hour or so ago. Areas at risk are also marked, so you know if somewhere is safe to drive through or stay in. Helpful stuff, considering wildfires are so numerous and dangerous that it&#8217;s hard to keep track of them now.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2209691\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/treecanopytool.png\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2209691\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2209691\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/treecanopytool.png\" alt=\"Map of Denver with an overlay showing areas with high and low tree cover.\" width=\"1024\" height=\"636\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/treecanopytool.png 1404w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/treecanopytool.png?resize=150,93 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/treecanopytool.png?resize=300,186 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/treecanopytool.png?resize=768,477 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/treecanopytool.png?resize=680,422 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/treecanopytool.png?resize=50,31 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2209691\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>In cities, Google has provided its &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/insights.sustainability.google\/labs\/treecanopy\">Environmental Insights Explorer Tree Canopy tool<\/a>&#8221; to 15 U.S. cities, using aerial imagery to identify heat islands and other risk areas. Municipalities can use this to plan where to plant new trees or otherwise dedicate resources. First tested in LA, the tool will now expand to 100 cities around the globe, including Guadalajara, London, Sydney, Toronto and Tokyo.<\/p>\n<p>Another kind of data municipal authorities sometimes don&#8217;t have, especially in sparsely populated rural or fast-changing urban environments, is addresses. It sounds odd that a place might just not have an address, but streets and numbers do after all have to be assigned, registered, tracked and used in order for things like mail and deliveries to arrive. Poorer and rural areas are often at risk of having to just use a nearby official address and rely on extra instructions or a knowledgeable delivery person to get mail reliably.<\/p>\n<p>Several years back Google introduced &#8220;Plus Codes,&#8221; which are basically GPS coordinates tied to a short series of letters and numbers that can be entered into lots of online address services, including of course Google Maps. Even if you don&#8217;t have an actual street address, you can have a Plus Code and it ought to be enough to get someone to your door.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2209689\" style=\"width: 897px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pluscode.jpg\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2209689\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2209689\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pluscode.jpg\" alt=\"A remote cabin with a popup above it showing a Google &quot;plus code&quot; that acts as an address.\" width=\"887\" height=\"612\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pluscode.jpg 887w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pluscode.jpg?resize=150,103 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pluscode.jpg?resize=300,207 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pluscode.jpg?resize=768,530 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pluscode.jpg?resize=680,469 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/pluscode.jpg?resize=50,34 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 887px) 100vw, 887px\" \/><\/a><p id=\"caption-attachment-2209689\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Now they&#8217;ve partnered with several local governments struggling to assign addresses in a regular way, integrating Plus Codes with the official machinery of governance. In The Gambia and Kenya, for instance, the Plus Codes will work for national ID cards and other purposes that would normally require a government-verified address. To be clear, the information is owned and administrated by the government, not Google, which just helps generate the codes and integrate them with existing online infrastructure. (There&#8217;s a new <a href=\"https:\/\/services.google.com\/fb\/forms\/addressmaker\/\">bulk creation tool<\/a> that helps generate street directions as well.)<\/p>\n<p>All these tools emphasize Google&#8217;s interest in public-private partnerships \u2014 a cynic may think that they simply want to get their hooks in every aspect of life, but really the company, despite its advertising and surveillance business model, has always pushed projects like this. It genuinely hopes to transform industries and governments, and occasionally has some success doing it. At the very least these projects seem to lack much in the way of self-interest and could be quite useful to people around the world.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google has updates for a handful of tools aimed at helping people use Maps for more, or get on them in the first place.

At the company&#8217;s <a href=\"https:\/\/searchon.withgoogle.com\/live\/\">Search On<\/a> event, the company demonstrated new features, including those that leverage MUM, to better connect web searchers to the content they&#8217;re looking for, while also making web search feel more natural and intuitive.<\/p>\n<p>One of the features being launched is called &#8220;Things to know,&#8221; which will focus on making it easier for people to understand new topics they&#8217;re searching for. This feature understands how people typically explore various topics and then shows web searchers the aspects of the topic people are most likely to look at first.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2209223\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2209223\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2209223\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Search-On-Things-to-Know.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2209223\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>For example, Google explained, if you were searching for &#8220;acrylic painting,&#8221; it may suggest &#8220;Things to know&#8221; like how to get started with painting, step-by-step, or the different styles of acrylic painting, tips about acrylic painting, how to clean acrylic paint, and more. In this example, Google is able to identify over 350 different topics related to acrylic painting, it notes.<\/p>\n<p>This feature will launch in the coming months, but Google notes it will also be expanded in the future by using MUM to help web users unlock even deeper insights into the topic beyond what they may have thought to look for &#8212; like &#8220;how to make acrylic paintings with household items.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2209221\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2209221\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2209221\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Search-On-Visual-Ideas.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2209221\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>The company is also developing new ways to help web users both refine and broaden their searches without having to start over with a new query.<\/p>\n<p>To continue the acrylic painting example, Google may offer to connect you to information about specific painting techniques, like puddle pouring, or art classes you could take. You could then zoom into one of those other topics in order to see a visually rich page of search results and ideas from across the web, including articles, images, videos and more.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2210054\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2210054\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-2210054 size-large\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg 2806w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=150,86 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=300,171 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=768,438 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=680,388 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=1536,876 1536w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=2048,1168 2048w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Screen-Shot-2021-09-29-at-1.19.24-PM.jpg?resize=50,29 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2210054\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>These pages are meant to better compete with Pinterest, it seems, as they&#8217;re also able to help people become inspired by searches &#8212; similar to how Pinterest&#8217;s image-heavy pinboard aims to turn people&#8217;s visual inspiration into action &#8212; like visiting a website or making an online purchase.<\/p>\n<p>Google says the pages will be useful for searches where users are &#8220;looking for inspiration,&#8221; like &#8220;Halloween decorating ideas&#8221; or &#8220;indoor vertical garden ideas&#8221; or other ideas to try. This feature can be tried out today on mobile devices.<\/p>\n<p>Google is also upgrading video search. Already, the company uses AI to identify key moments inside a video. Now, it will take things further with the launch of a feature that will identify the topics in a video &#8212; even if the topic isn&#8217;t explicitly mentioned in the video &#8212; then provide links that allow users to dig deeper and learn more.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2209224\" style=\"width: 690px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2209224\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-large wp-image-2209224\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Search-On-Related-Topics-in-Videos.gif?w=680\" alt=\"\" width=\"680\" height=\"680\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2209224\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"><strong>Image Credits:<\/strong> Google<\/p><\/div><\/p>\n<p>That means when you&#8217;re watching a YouTube video, MUM will be used to understand what the video is about and make suggestions. In an example, a video about Macaroni penguins may point users to a range of related videos, like those that talk about how Macaroni penguins find their family members and navigate predators. MUM can identify these terms to search for, even if they&#8217;re not explicitly said in the video.<\/p>\n<p>This feature will roll out in an initial version on YouTube Search in the weeks ahead, and will be updated to include more visual enhancements in the coming months, says Google.<\/p>\n<p>This change could also help to drive increased search traffic to Google, by leveraging YouTube&#8217;s sizable reach. Many Gen Z users already search for online content differently than older generations, <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/how-gen-z-searches-for-content\">studies have found<\/a>. They tend to use multiple social media channels, have a mobile-first mindset and are engaged with video content. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thinkwithgoogle.com\/advertising-channels\/video\/gen-z-and-youtube\/\">A &#8220;Think with Google&#8221; study,<\/a> for instance, found that 85% of Gen Z teenagers would use YouTube regularly to find content, while 80% said YouTube videos had successfully taught them something. Other data had <a href=\"https:\/\/blog.hubspot.com\/marketing\/gen-z-stats\">demonstrated<\/a> that Gen Z prefers to learn about new ideas and products through video as well, not text, native ads or other content formats.<\/p>\n<p>For Google, this sort of addition may be necessary because the shift to mobile is impacting its search dominance. Today, many mobile shopping searches today <a href=\"https:\/\/britewire.com\/amazon-beats-google-in-product-searches\/\">now start directly<\/a> on Amazon. Plus, when iPhone users need to do something specific on their phone, they often turn to Siri, Spotlight, the App Store, or a native app to get help.<\/p>\n<p>Google also today <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/09\/28\/google-introduces-a-new-way-to-search-that-combines-images-and-text-into-one-query\">unveiled<\/a> how it&#8217;s using MUM technology to improve visual searches using Google Lens.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Google announced today it will be applying AI advancements, including a new technology called Multitask Unified Model (MUM) to improve Google Search.

The hard truth is that RPA is a decades-old technology that is brittle with real limits to its capabilities. It will always have some value in automating work that is simple, discrete, and linear. However, the reason automation efforts often fall short of their aspirations is because so much of life is complex and constantly evolving &#8211; too much work falls outside of the capabilities of RPA. In this talk, Varun Ganapathi, Ph.D., Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer of AKASA will discuss how exceptions and outliers can actually make automation stronger and how emerging machine-learning-based technology platforms combined with human-in-the-loop approaches are already expanding what it is possible to automate across a number of industries.","title":"Future Forward: How Machine Learning and Human-in-the-Loop Approaches Are Expanding the Capabilities of Automation","videoUrl":"","sessionTypeId":0,"speakers":[{"name":"Varun Ganapathi","uuid":"564d8e601f91776b9ce6201af27cc6271632424483","cb_tag":576924146}],"sponsors":[{"address":{"city":"","country":"","state":"","street1":"","street2":"","zip":""},"categories":[],"content":"AKASA is building the future of healthcare with AI.
